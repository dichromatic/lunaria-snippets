#### Set around 1300 A.D

That was an awfully hot day. 

“Whyyy??? Won’t you let me stay for one night? Koya-chan is soooo stingy!!”

This is the worst. 

<!-- more -->

Since it was so fucking hot, I thought I’d go to the bar to cool off. Then, I happened to sit next to her in the bar.

“What are you saying? Why not just die?”

“Ahhh! I got it! How about this instead: why don’t we have… a.... drinking contest? The first one to go out cold… loses…”

Of course she instantly goes out. She’s so fucking careless sometimes… 

“Oi! Wake up! You already lost…. Stupid…”

She’s really fucking out cold. How’s she supposed to get home like this?

“Hey uh… miss? She’s your acquaintance isn’t she?”

Oh fucking great. Now I have to pay for her. How do I even manage to get myself caught up in this shit? I swear looking at her sleeping face all smug and cute just pisses me off. 

---

“Oi! Get up! Lie on the futon so you don’t break your back when you sleep!”

“Hmm?”

Honestly, this girl is such a handful. I guess this is what you get when you’re a princess? Are all princesses just naturally carefree? Sheltered? She rarely goes outside anyway, so why was she at the bar before? Wha- WHAT is she DOING? 

“What are you DOING! Go to sleep you stupid! Stop hugging me! And get your face off of m- NNnnkmmmsdmfskmkmmmMmm”

WHAT THE FUCK!!! Why is she kissing me??? WHATTT.

“Hahh… huh? WHY THE FUCK DID YOU FALL ASLEEP??? UGhhhhhh.”

….
….

/././…

This is really the worst...

“...Ugh….”

Yesterday was so fucking hot… Today is as well, for some god forsaken reason. I should wake Chang’e up and make out- make her help me out… I CAN’T get that SHIT out of my head! Why the FUCK am I weeding today, out of all the days it could’ve been? So tired of just everything….

“AHHH!! What the hell!!! Just go die already you stupid!!!”

“What are you shouting about so early in the morning?”

“ARGHHH!!! The hell are you doing? Don’t stand behind me and just… casually touch me!”

“Wear a hat will you? You’re gonna die of heatstroke if you don't, y’know?”

“Just SHUT UP!!! You’re the one who’s going to die!”

“Why do you always have to be so hard to reason with? Stop with the weeding Koya-chan, I want to eat some soumen with you~”

Is she stupid or something? How is she acting so normal after… after...

“-you… You… More importantly… you… D-don’t do something like that and then show such a calm face!!”

“Uhhh… What are you talking about? Do what?”

….
… sigh...

What the hell? She must be joking right? There was a saying along the lines of “tThe body remembers” right? This just makes me look like a complete idiot… Well I guess she was dead drunk… and maybe it’s just a trivial matter for her? Well anyway…

“...I’ll walk you home. And I’ll make some soumen for you too. Come on, let’s go”

“W-wait, Koya-chan!”

“W-what?”

“Um… why is your face so red? Are you alright?”

“...you’re too close…”

Your face is also red too, y’know? Oh, look who came to pick her up.

“Princess! Finally, I’ve found you. Please don’t leave the palace at such late times again. Oh, and thank you, Koyane-kun. You’re always welcome to visit anytime. I’m sure Chang’e would be delighted to have you over. Come on, let’s go home.”

“Wait! We aren’t finished yet though… and I wanted to eat with Koya-chan…”

“Ah, but we have some business to deal with regarding the clinic, I’m afraid. Perhaps you can return here for dinner? It won’t be as hot anymore as well, I presume.”

“Oh and also, I just wanted to go for a drink with Koya-chan last night… and then we… oh.”

---

Welp. I guess that’s that. Her grandma really is a slave driver isn’t she? I feel bad for all the assistants that work for her clinic. Yeesh. Guess I’ll head back inside…

“Wait!”

Did she forget something or…

“Did you forget something?”


“Yes. I forgot something…”

“What di-fsjsnfdmmmph…”

WHAT?! SHE’S KISSING ME AGAIN!!!!”

“Hah…”

“Um… I want to make sure. That was the second time, right?”

This bitch…

“DON'T ASK FOR CONFIRMATION AFTER YOU’VE DONE IT!!!”

“Ah, so that was the second time! Sorry, I forgot!!”

“JUST DIEE ALREADYYY!!!”
