<p>“It’s interesting to think that even in our time, our old world’s secrets still lie in the dark. Perhaps I should do something about that...”</p>
<p>It’s dinner time in the Zhi household. As Eri tries to feed her hyperactive toddler running around the living room, Ziwei grumbles from the couch.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>“Look mom, I don’t know what you’re planning now, but don’t make me help you like last time. That almost ended in complete disaster.” </p>
<p>Ziwei deadpans. She would have laughed, if her mother’s attempts at saving face weren’t so pathetic.</p>
<p>“Ahaha… nothing of the sort dear. But considering that whole debacle last time, some playful retaliation might be in order… those princesses really need a reminder of their place in this world.”</p>
<p>“Soooo… you’re basically trying to save yourself from embarrassment. What are you gonna do? Leak some insanely classified document from some abandoned military vault in the USA?”</p>
<p>Her mother’s face visibly lights up, and Ziwei instantly knew she fucked up.</p>
<p>“HAHAHAHA! My goodness, you really are my daughter. That sounds like an excellent idea! I should have thought of that earlier!.” </p>
<p>Ziyun reaches into an open slip, and pulls out a stack of papers. The heavy presence is noticed, and promptly ignored by everyone.</p>
<p>Ziwei heaves a very long sigh. Back to scrolling Ttwatter again, I guess. Unless...</p>
<p>“I think I’m gonna hang out at Marice’s place for a while. Call me- actually, don't call me, especially if you need anything. Ciao.”</p>
<p>“Ok! Have fun dear!” From the angle of the dining table, Ziwei just haphazardly sinks through the couch and disappears. </p>
<p>The running toddler finally relents, and Eri manages to grab and carry her to the dining table. “C’mon Hina, you have to eat! You know it’s important for your health. Eat the veggies too. Here, say aaahhhhh...”</p>
<p>Sifting through the large collection of documents, Ziyun stops on a stapled set of a few hundred pages titled ‘Discourses on the Lunar War, 1969-1984.’</p>
<p>“HAHAhahahahAHa, I knew humans still had records of this somewhere! Still such deviant creatures they are. Some things just never change, it seems. These documents might even be able to spark tension between some Lunarians and humans, but I’m sure they know better these days.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Did you finally get a hold of the records of the Human-Lunar war, mistress? I thought they’d have been destroyed by now… surely this is already public knowledge though? I feel like this was written down somewhere in the Articles of Unification...”</p>
<p>“Well of course it is, dear, but I doubt most people would have read through it thoroughly. It is a blatheringly long document after all. Hell, I signed it myself as the representative of the Order of Magicians;, of all people, I would be most expected to know. But instead, I’ve forgotten most of it. You were there, were you not?”</p>
<p>“I believe I was dealing with business from Chang’e at the time. I fear I can not relate to you, mistress. I can remember almost everything to the smallest detail.” </p>
<p>“Well, that's why I have you to remember for me and do all the other boring stuff.” </p>
<p>Ziyun gives Eri a warm look. A face she only shows to those closest.</p>
<p>“As I always say, behind a great woman is another great woman.”</p>

<h4 id="note-laozi-and-omoikane-are-the-same-person-they-are-all-earlean-lol">NOTE: LAOZI AND OMOIKANE ARE THE SAME PERSON they are all earlean lol</h4>
<p>“Hey Wei, what’s your mom been up to lately? Haven’t heard from her since those two princesses made a big deal out of her. If a drinking contest could even be called a big deal… bit of a scummy move from those princesses, huh?”</p>
<p>The Nebulio-Bucurie household is a homey wood cottage in the middle of apparently nowhere. Endless forest is the default view for most of the windows inside the cottage. Unless Maurice accidentally flattens a clearing by sneezing, of course.</p>
<p>“I dunno really, she’s planning something funny apparently. Those two princesses are really annoying so they probably deserve it. Anyway, why the hell do you still live out here dude? It’s like, a billion miles from anywhere. Not everyone can teleport, you know.” </p>
<p>“It’s really nice out here. I can be as loud as I want and no one complains. Basically heaven. Oh, Aless is also with me.” </p>
<p>“I’m always with you though? And don’t mention me so offhandedly like that…”</p>
<p>Alessi walks into the room with a tray of sweets and a teapot and sets it down on the table. Ziwei immediately swipes at one.</p>
<p>“It’s been quiet these days, hasn’t it? Feels nice for the world to finally be at rest for a while.”</p>
<p>Alessi pours herself a cup of tea. </p>
<p>“Dunno about that Aless, it’s a bit boring. Been a decade since anything fun happened. That was when all the craze about Lunarians finally coming out of hiding was a thing. I mean, I didn’t even know they bothered hiding way back when the Magical East was still a thing.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t know because you were too busy being drunk instead of listening to Laozi and Chang’e during cherry blossom viewings. They were a huge wealth of information, especially for us foreigners.” </p>
<p>“Those two escaped from the Moon because of how stupid the two princesses were. Hell, didn’t a majority of them escape the solar system because of how stupid they were? I wonder where they went.” </p>
<p>Leave it to Ziwei to be unnecessarily mean and correct. Although it wasn’t the main reason for their escape, the princesses were stupid. And annoying.</p>
<p>“Wait, there are Lunarians outside of the solar system? Since when?” Alessi sips at her tea.</p>
<p>“-Ah shit. That was supposed to be confidential information. Well anyway, you two should probably know considering our connections to Omoikane. But a large portion of the Lunarians left the Moon shortly after Chang’e was banished to Earth around 500 years ago. Probably due to some internal strife or something, I don’t really remember the details. Omoikane was supposed to go with them to another star system, but she went with Chang’e instead.”</p>
<p>“Hah, no wonder she went with Chang’e instead. Chang’e can’t take care of herself for shit! Damn smug bitch never bothered going outside of her house.”</p>
<p>“Marice! Don’t be so rude!” Alessi scolds the young man. Now Maurice was also being mean for some reason.</p>
<p>“Whaddaya mean? They were always mean to us anyway. Remember when we had to deal with one of their emergency drills in case there was a lunar invasion? It was pitch black for practically a whole week. It’s already painful dealing with spirits for just a single night, let alone an entire week. Not to mention when the two princesses actually bothered trying to one up Ziyun by threatening the entire Earth with armageddon. Ziyun absolutely handed their asses to them. Point is, Lunarians are weird and mean sometimes. But they’re cool too I guess. Chang’e is pretty nice to talk to when she isn’t being a smug bitch. There was also that one messenger of Omoikane who had that insanely complicated name, she was pretty cool. Oh and-” </p>
<p>Another one of Marice’s ramblings triggered. Just perfect. Ziwei tuned him out as usual, while Alessi listened intensely, also as usual. She wondered when her mom was gonna start posting those supposedly classified papers everywhere. She really wanted to see those princesses’ dealing with her mom’s bullshit all over again. Hoping for something funny, Ziwei turns on the holoscreen.</p>
<p>Breaking News: Human-Lunar war documents leak online. Currently waiting on confirmation by the United States Government and the Lunarian Royalty.</p>
<p>“Wow, she actually did it. Hey Marice! Stop rambling! Mom finally did something!”</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="this-section-is-set-in-2nd-of-may-2235">This section is set in 2nd of May, 2235</h4>
<p>“At last, you’ve decided to settle their fate once and for all. I suppose requesting you to act in a more discreet manner is irrelevant now.”</p>
<p>There has always been something about oriental architecture that Ziyun loved. Well, it is her culture after all. An interesting fact about pre-ancient Lunarian architecture is that it mildly resembles most of East Asia’s architecture; a fact that both Earlean and Ziyun are intimately familiar with, down to its fundamental reasoning.</p>
<p>“This is somewhat out of character for me, but I honestly do not have a clue how you can be more discreet than this. In any case, you know exactly what I came here for. I only hope Chang’e is prepared to face the outside world once more.”</p>
<p>“If I may be so frank, you are extremely out of character. You do realise we are alone, in my humble abode? There is no need to act so rigid.” </p>
<p>Honestly, calling the Lunar Palace a “humble abode” is stretching the words past breaking point. It’s a wonder why Earlean and Chang’e need so much space when only five people live here at most, let alone three people permanently. The palace itself is grand; befitting of an elder Lunarian and ex-Lunarian royalty. The room they’re in isn’t all that special though. A tea room with a small table in the centre, occupied by Ziyun and Earlean facing each other. The night sky visible through the open sliding screen is clear with hints of overcast looming over the horizon.</p>
<p>Ziyun’s face loosens, expression turning playful. Well, here we go.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, that completely flew past my head. Forgive me, I did just come back from a meeting with those bigwigs from the United States. You know, I still don’t understand why you prefer to keep quiet when it comes to those two princesses. They fear you absolutely as an elder. We could have easily saved ourselves time if you simply… removed their power.” </p>
<p>While only playful in intention, Ziyun’s smile could easily be mistaken as predatory.</p>
<p>“You, of all people, know very well that ruling with an iron fist is unwise. But I’m afraid the true reason is far more personal than I’d like to admit.”</p>
<p>In a rare display of emotion, Earlean gazes at the full moon in reminiscence. Ziyun savours moments like these with those closest to her. She’s sure Earlean feels the same. </p>
<p>“Chang’e will be fine. Her husband and I have supported her recovery these past few centuries. She will make a great figure for us Lunarians, and humanity as an extension.”</p>
<p>Ziyun sips at her tea. </p>
<p>“On the other hand, you’ll be the one stealing the spotlight for the foreseeable future. After all, you will be peacefully taking all the power the princesses have.”</p>
<p>Earlean stares back at Ziyun’s twin violet abyss. Her expression becomes unreadable, but she heaves a sigh.</p>
<p>“I suppose it is time to come out of hiding.” </p>
<p>Earlean sips at her tea.</p>
<p>“In other, more exciting news, dear Ziwei is finally entering university is she not? Or has she changed plans once again?”</p>
<p>The abrupt change in atmosphere mirrored the equally abrupt topic change. Never change, Earlean. Never change.</p>
<p>“Riiight, I forgot she was supposed to get into a university recently. She never tells me these things. Instead, all she does is keep going on and on about how much money she doesn’t have when she can just ask me for some… dear oh dear. ”</p>
<p>“Ah, so in conclusion, you do not know if she’s entering university or not. How responsible.”</p>
<p>“Hey! Don’t be like that! She’s free to do whatever she wants… and all that jazz... “ </p>
<p>Really, trying to hide it was just a tad pathetic at this point. Earlean just wanted to laugh. So she chuckled.</p>
<p>“Oh come on… it’s not that funny… don’t make me feel like I failed parenthood or something.”</p>
<p>Ziyun can’t help but join in on the snickers. The wind drifting through the open screen is soothing, and crisp.</p>
<p>“Oh my. I do appreciate times like these. Although, it seems it has become less frequent lately. A shame.”</p>
<p>“The world is changing after all. And I’ve made the fairly idiotic decision of piloting the ship.”</p>
<p>“Nothing new for you I suppose. Or both of us, for that matter.”</p>
<p>They both sip at their tea.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="set-on-the-19th-of-may-2235">Set on the 19th of May, 2235</h4>
<p>“By unanimous consent from every and all existing recognised governing bodies, humanity is hereby declared a unity of the three Precursor Lunarian families. Therefore, all currently existing governments must now adhere to the fundamental laws prescribed under the previously written Articles of Unification, in addition to amendments proposed during the proceedings of this current summit. Speaking on behalf of humanity, we look forward to the future, together.” </p>
<p>This decade’s worldwide summit is being held in Mare Serenitatis* - a decision which, before last month’s Lunarian debacle, didn't hold much weight other than a random roll of luck for the Lunarians. Unfortunately for the Lunarian governing body and royalty, none of the events leading up to this day werewas left up to lady luck. A roar of applause resounds throughout the Hall of Serenity, an ancient relic of Lunarians past. </p>
<p>To the average Earthling, the tidally-locked moon they saw in the night sky was always static. Gray. Constant and unchanging. What else would one expect from an uninhabited planetary body? But for some reason, people have always believed in something much more majestic; the oh so lustrous moon, with gods and other celestial beings roaming the beautiful seas adorned with lovely green islands. Buzz Aldrin would have been disappointed to find nothing but dust and rocks, rather than a beautiful fair-skinned lady and her rabbit companion under the shade of a cinnamon tree**.</p>
<p>And then, humanity finally saw the true beauty of their moon. Seas as blue as Earth itself, littered with green specks of islands. Humanity’s previously misplaced faith in the moon - suddenly fell perfectly into its place. Hell, the moon was even full of beautiful people.</p>
<p>The summit’s atmosphere is lighthearted - one of the many reliefs Ziyun appreciated when attending a suffocating event full of individuals with sticks shoved so far up their asses. Currently seated with Grandmaster Archmage of the Western Order, Nilam Norre, her coven members Master Archmages Marice Nebulio and Alessi Bucurie and last but not least, her very own Master Archmage, Eri Ran, assistant (babysitter) and her right-hand woman. Their table represents the autonomous magical provinces of their respective regions. As always, Marice and Alessi were engaged in their own conversation while Nilam looked sorely out of place, pajamas and all.</p>
<p>Glancing at the table adjacent, Ziyun spots the Lunarian royalty accompanied by Earlean, Chang’e and her husband. Under the princesses’ well-rehearsed smiles, astute eyes could gather they weren’t very happy with their current predicament. Or was it a sense of defeat? Either way, catharsis was one of Ziyun’s favourite pastimes. So for some much needed appetizers, she decides to make her way over to their table.</p>
<p>Cracks formed in the princesses’ facade as soon as Ziyun’s presence was noticed.</p>
<p>“Good evening, fellow humans. Oh, and good evening, your highnesses. You’ve certainly outdone yourselves on deciding a location for this summit. I certainly love visiting the Sea of Serenity once in a red moon***. Mind if I take a seat?”</p>
<p>Ziyun settles with a menacingly mute smile. </p>
<p>“Of course, Grandmaster Zhi. Let me help you to your seat.”</p>
<p>Ah, charming as always that Koyane is. Ziyun took a liking to Chang’e’s husband/wife almost as soon as she met him; albeit somewhat crass and irritable, he is endearing at the best of times. Practically perfect for someone of Chang’e’s nature. Ziyun takes the seat facing Earlean, with Chang’e on her left and Phobos to her right.</p>
<p>“If I may be so intrusive, how are Lunarians handling the transfer of power? If I recall correctly, the United Nations do expect each of us to have a representative for each precursor descendant family member. Grandmaster Norre has graciously surrendered the opportunity to myself, which I do have to say is a shame for us magicians. She would make a great leader.”</p>
<p>“The Lunarian Royalty has made the decision to step down from most official governmental roles in Lunarian society, as it has been voted by a majority of Lunarians for the governing body to have a more active role in humanity’s affairs. The royalty, regrettably, has been at the very least, a detriment to the past relations involving humanity. From now on, we will take more active roles in diplomacy to hopefully mend our mistakes.”</p>
<p>What an absolute delight. Ziyun didn’t even ask for it, and they’ve already given up. If it weren’t for the pricelessly defeated expressions on the princesses’ faces, Ziyun probably would have been severely disappointed. It’s apparently extremely hard to conceal any smugness from a smile in a situation like this, given Ziyun herself is currently struggling.</p>
<p>“I wish you both luck in your diplomatic endeavours. Perhaps then, a toast… to the future of Lunarian society, and humanity in general.”</p>
<p>Unenthused, the princesses Phobos and Deimos raise their glasses. The drink itself isn’t too bad. Ziyun does have peculiar tastes, though.</p>
<p>“I suppose then, dear Earlean here is the Lunarian representative for humanity?”</p>
<p>The table nods. Not that she needed any confirmation. </p>

<p>** Chang’'e was mentioned in a conversation between Houston CAPCOM and the Apollo 11 crew just before the first Moon landing in 1969:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>Ronald Evans (CC): “Among the large headlines concerning Apollo this morning, is one asking that you watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit. An ancient legend says the girl named Chang’e-O has been living there for 4,000 years. It seems she was banished to the Moon because she stole the pill of immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is always standing on his hind feet in the shade of a cinnamon tree.”
</span></code></pre>
<p>*** A red moon is an event where there was a higher chance of spiriting away happening, due to the illusionary border between the Moon and the Earth weakening. Sometimes, people were spirited away to the true Lunar surface, a phenomenon which Zhi loved to manipulate.</p>

<h4 id="set-on-the-20th-of-may-2235">Set on the 20th of May, 2235</h4>
<p>“Now that we finally have some time to ourselves away from public eyes, please help yourselves to some of the sake from my special collection. I assure you it will make this occasion much more enjoyable.”</p>
<p>Even as Lunaria’s previous princess, Chang’e always hated high-class social events with a fiery passion. She would much rather be in the comfortable confines of her bed, sleeping her worries away. Serenity Palace was the holiday house Chang’e loved to visit in her younger days. Laozi would take her to the island in her meagre spare time; something she would always appreciate from her grandmother. Returning after a few centuries though, the atmosphere throughout the palace has changed for the worse, in her humble opinion. Something felt slightly off about each hallway and room - as if neglect suffused through the wooden floors and paper-thin walls.</p>
<p>The tea room they were in wasn’t much better, but at least it was one of the rooms Chang’e was most familiar with. Seated in between her dear grandmother and Ziyun, Chang’e poured a dish for both princesses settled by the other side of the table.</p>
<p>“Well then, it seems both Yori-chan and Toyo-chan* will be joining me and Grandma for our Earth tour! There are soooo many wonderful people I’d love for you both to meet in our world.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Chang’e-a-yi.”</p>
<p>Unenthused was the word of the day for the princesses apparently.</p>
<p>“In all honesty, I’m looking forward to meeting your daughter again, Grandmaster. She was an interesting one.”</p>
<p>“Knowing my dear daughter, I don’t think she’d be too keen on visits from someone who has the potential to match her in magical prowess. But if you insist, please be kind to her, Yori-kun.”</p>
<p>Ziyun drinks from her sake dish.</p>
<p>Ziyun felt a tinge of regret for effectively neutering the princesses - was she too harsh on them? Perhaps she could have approached the issue from another angle? Ah well. Maybe the answer will come when she’s a few dishes in. Right now, her only job is to be amicable with the royalty.</p>
<p>“Oh, her technical mastery is accelerating quite rapidly though - she will be able to match your prowess in less than a few months, if my prediction is correct. Perhaps that is the thing you should be looking forward to instead…”</p>
<p>“Ah right, Ziwei is under the tutelage of the crazed battle maniac’s coven, is she not? No wonder she’s progressing rapidly. And well, she has the help of none other than yourself…” </p>
<p>“Ahahaha, now now Toyo-kun, I’ve simply been doing what any mother would…”</p>
<p>“Actually, Ziwei is much more powerful than most of us here in terms of spell card duels. She’s defeated us in those battles so many times before… I still think about the time we accidentally turned on our defense systems and Ziwei came guns blazing on the lunar palace… that was crazy.”</p>
<p>Change’e shivers at the memory - it was an event her and Earlean were intimately familiar with. Even Ziyun has gripes with how her daughter did her job back in the Magical East as their guardian and protector. She was also the victim of a “guns blazing” event after all.</p>
<p>“Dear Ziwei can be frightening at times… even as her mother I couldn’t escape her wrath. You girls are really lucky that you haven’t faced Ziwei at her peak. I doubt your avatar-calling power could match her at that point. After all, both Yori-kun and Ziwei have the same power. Except Ziwei can handle multiple avatars at one time...”</p>
<p>Earlean knew Ziyun was just showing her daughter off (like she always did). She quietly shook her head in mock disappointment, unnoticed by everyone but Ziyun. Well, her daughter is very special after all. The guardian of the Magical East was a magician no one wanted to cross paths with after they learned of her attitude towards non-compliant actors. Most of the wild incidents recorded in the Chronicles of the Eastern Country after 1000 A.D were resolved by the guardian alone. But the guardian’s personal life was never recorded anywhere in the Chronicles; she was practically as anonymous as any random citizen could get. Only those present for the events know who she truly is.</p>
<p>“I think the funniest thing is that she’s finally going to university. And out of all the things she could be studying, she’s studying theology. As if she doesn’t have a PhD in that field already. University really is just for the certificate, huh? Seems like a waste of time to me.”</p>
<p>Not that Chang’e could relate, but going to university seems like a huge pain in the ass. She’d rather stay at home all day like she used to do.</p>
<p>“Chang’e dear, I do not think you are on grounds to speak about ‘going to university’ in any way. I still vividly recall your attitude towards leaving the palace before you met Koyane-kun. Let alone leaving your room for more than ten minutes. You should realise most people attend university to learn.”</p>
<p>Earlean sounds quite cross even though her expression is statically neutral. Chang’e looks away in mild embarrassment, her red cheeks accentuated by the alcohol.</p>
<p>“W-well, I just didn’t like going outside. It was scary after all…”</p>
<p>Earlean wraps an arm around Chang’e, which only helps accentuate her redness.</p>
<p>“As long as you understand.”</p>
<p>Ziyun felt something slightly off about the princesses on the other side of the table. It felt something akin to envy or jealousy… Were they envious of the relationship between Chang’e and their venerable elder? Ziyun had a hunch that they’ve always longed to gain recognition from Earlean, as she was their beloved teacher in the past. It seems now though, the newfound guilt for their past actions adds some depth to their yearning. </p>
<p>“Cheer up girls! It’s about time us Humans finally got together, don’t you think? Let us toast, to boundaries surpassed, complacency relinquished, and everlasting peace between our bloodlines.” </p>
<p>They all raised their dishes, some less enthused.</p>
