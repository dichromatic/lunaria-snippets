            <h4 id="set-around-1300-a-d">Set around 1300 A.D</h4>
<p>That was an awfully hot day. </p>
<p>“Whyyy??? Won’t you let me stay for one night? Koya-chan is soooo stingy!!”</p>
<p>This is the worst. </p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Since it was so fucking hot, I thought I’d go to the bar to cool off. Then, I happened to sit next to her in the bar.</p>
<p>“What are you saying? Why not just die?”</p>
<p>“Ahhh! I got it! How about this instead: why don’t we have… a.... drinking contest? The first one to go out cold… loses…”</p>
<p>Of course she instantly goes out. She’s so fucking careless sometimes… </p>
<p>“Oi! Wake up! You already lost…. Stupid…”</p>
<p>She’s really fucking out cold. How’s she supposed to get home like this?</p>
<p>“Hey uh… miss? She’s your acquaintance isn’t she?”</p>
<p>Oh fucking great. Now I have to pay for her. How do I even manage to get myself caught up in this shit? I swear looking at her sleeping face all smug and cute just pisses me off. </p>
<hr />
<p>“Oi! Get up! Lie on the futon so you don’t break your back when you sleep!”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Honestly, this girl is such a handful. I guess this is what you get when you’re a princess? Are all princesses just naturally carefree? Sheltered? She rarely goes outside anyway, so why was she at the bar before? Wha- WHAT is she DOING? </p>
<p>“What are you DOING! Go to sleep you stupid! Stop hugging me! And get your face off of m- NNnnkmmmsdmfskmkmmmMmm”</p>
<p>WHAT THE FUCK!!! Why is she kissing me??? WHATTT.</p>
<p>“Hahh… huh? WHY THE FUCK DID YOU FALL ASLEEP??? UGhhhhhh.”</p>
<p>….
….</p>
<p>/././…</p>
<p>This is really the worst...</p>
<hr />
<p>“...Ugh….”</p>
<p>Yesterday was so fucking hot… Today is as well, for some god forsaken reason. I should wake Chang’e up and make out- make her help me out… I CAN’T get that SHIT out of my head! Why the FUCK am I weeding today, out of all the days it could’ve been? So tired of just everything….</p>
<p>“AHHH!! What the hell!!! Just go die already you stupid!!!”</p>
<p>“What are you shouting about so early in the morning?”</p>
<p>“ARGHHH!!! The hell are you doing? Don’t stand behind me and just… casually touch me!”</p>
<p>“Wear a hat will you? You’re gonna die of heatstroke if you don't, y’know?”</p>
<p>“Just SHUT UP!!! You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p>
<p>“Why do you always have to be so hard to reason with? Stop with the weeding Koya-chan, I want to eat some soumen with you~”</p>
<p>Is she stupid or something? How is she acting so normal after… after...</p>
<p>“-you… You… More importantly… you… D-don’t do something like that and then show such a calm face!!”</p>
<p>“Uhhh… What are you talking about? Do what?”</p>
<p>….
… sigh...</p>
<p>What the hell? She must be joking right? There was a saying along the lines of “tThe body remembers” right? This just makes me look like a complete idiot… Well I guess she was dead drunk… and maybe it’s just a trivial matter for her? Well anyway…</p>
<p>“...I’ll walk you home. And I’ll make some soumen for you too. Come on, let’s go”</p>
<p>“W-wait, Koya-chan!”</p>
<p>“W-what?”</p>
<p>“Um… why is your face so red? Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“...you’re too close…”</p>
<p>Your face is also red too, y’know? Oh, look who came to pick her up.</p>
<p>“Princess! Finally, I’ve found you. Please don’t leave the palace at such late times again. Oh, and thank you, Koyane-kun. You’re always welcome to visit anytime. I’m sure Chang’e would be delighted to have you over. Come on, let’s go home.”</p>
<p>“Wait! We aren’t finished yet though… and I wanted to eat with Koya-chan…”</p>
<p>“Ah, but we have some business to deal with regarding the clinic, I’m afraid. Perhaps you can return here for dinner? It won’t be as hot anymore as well, I presume.”</p>
<p>“Oh and also, I just wanted to go for a drink with Koya-chan last night… and then we… oh.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Welp. I guess that’s that. Her grandma really is a slave driver isn’t she? I feel bad for all the assistants that work for her clinic. Yeesh. Guess I’ll head back inside…</p>
<p>“Wait!”</p>
<p>Did she forget something or…</p>
<p>“Did you forget something?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I forgot something…”</p>
<p>“What di-fsjsnfdmmmph…”</p>
<p>WHAT?! SHE’S KISSING ME AGAIN!!!!”</p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>“Um… I want to make sure. That was the second time, right?”</p>
<p>This bitch…</p>
<p>“DON'T ASK FOR CONFIRMATION AFTER YOU’VE DONE IT!!!”</p>
<p>“Ah, so that was the second time! Sorry, I forgot!!”</p>
<p>“JUST DIEE ALREADYYY!!!”</p>
